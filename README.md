This repository contains examples of code written by Nathaniel Ruhl for the Horizon Crossing Navigational Method (HCNM).

The folder "analytical_HCNM" contains a couple scripts in which I create a simplified two-dimensional horizon crossing. I built this model in order to improve my numerical methods of "integrating the telescopic line of sight", as the simplified "two-dimensional" horizon crossing provides insight into the full procedure for a three-dimensional horizon crossing. This is just the beginning of a project that I continued in a computational physics class at Haverford College. 

"HCNM_orbital_velocity.py" is a quick simulation to evaluate how HCNM is affected by an innaccurate input orbital velocity. This script is from the full HCNM code and will not run by itself.

"lat-lon-msis.py" is a script that I sent to a collaborator to demonstrate my method for defining the latitude and longitude that are used as inputs to extract a density profile from the MSIS atmospheric density model.
