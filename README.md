This repository contains examples of code written by Nathaniel Ruhl for the Horizon Crossing Navigational Method (HCNM).

"HCNM_orbital_velocity.py" is a quick simulation to evaluate how HCNM is affected by an innaccurate input orbital velocity.

"lat-lon-msis.py" is a script that I sent to a collaborator to demonstrate my method for defining the latitude and longitude that are used as inputs to extract a density profile from the MSIS atmospheric density model.
