The directory "HorizonCrossingModel" contains code that I wrote for a final project in a computational physics class at Haverford College. In this project, I built a simplified, semi-analytical "toy model" that provides insight into the numerical methods involved in the full analysis of a horizon crossing ([Ruhl et. al., 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CyGdmpl5s5cof4TH3svCVJ63uJd-CwQ6/view?usp=sharing)).
In oder to run code from this project, "HorizonCrossingModel/" must be the working directory.
