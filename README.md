This repository contains examples of code written by Nathaniel Ruhl for the Horizon Crossing Navigational Method (HCNM).

The directory "HorizonCrossingModel" contains code that I wrote for a final project in a computational physics class at Haverford College. In this project, I built a simplified, semi-analytical "toy model" that provides insight into the numerical methods involved in the full analysis of a horizon crossing ([Ruhl et. al., 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CyGdmpl5s5cof4TH3svCVJ63uJd-CwQ6/view?usp=sharing)).

"HCNM_orbital_velocity.py" is a quick simulation to evaluate how HCNM is affected by an innaccurate input orbital velocity. This script is from the full HCNM code and will not run by itself.

"lat-lon-msis.py" is a script that I sent to a collaborator to demonstrate my method for defining the latitude and longitude that are used as inputs to extract a density profile from the MSIS atmospheric density model.
